# Autonomous-Warehouse-Robot

## Overview

The Autonomous Warehouse Robot is a simulation project designed to demonstrate a robot's ability to navigate a warehouse environment, find packages, and pick them up. The robot utilizes the Frontier Planning algorithm for package detection and employs the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for navigation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/partharora1105/Autonomous-Warehouse-Robot.git
    ```

2. Run the simulation to find objects

    ```bash
    python main.py 1
    ```
3. Run the simulation to collect objects

    ```bash
    python main.py 2
    ```
